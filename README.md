# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Used libraries and dependencies

I used the following libraries and dependencies in my project:

"MUI" - react helps with styling and positioning , a component library

"axios": for making HTTP requests , allowing me to fetch data from APIs and interact with external resources.

"react" and "react-dom": These are fundamental React libraries - used for building the user interface and managing the application's component tree.

"react-router-dom": crucial for implementing client-side routing, ensuring that different views and pages can be navigated and rendered without a full page reload

The combination of these libraries and dependencies helped me efficiently create a well-styled, responsive, and interactive web application with seamless navigation and data fetching capabilities.
